Introduction
Over the years, the amount of data produced has grown exponentially. Text summarization, a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), helps mitigate information overload by extracting the most critical information from a text and presenting it in a condensed form.

There are two main summarization techniques:

Abstractive: Rephrases the content using different words.
Extractive: Selects and extracts the most relevant phrases directly from the text.
This notebook demonstrates the process of text summarization using Gemma, focusing on Kaggle write-ups and exploring various summarization techniques.

Setup and Important Aspects
This project leverages the following tools:

Gemma 2B Model: Lightweight model compatible with commercial GPUs.
HuggingFace: Provides abstraction for working with NLP models.
LangChain: Builds summarization pipelines for large documents.
Key Libraries Used:
PyTorch
HuggingFace Transformers
LangChain
PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
Pandas, NumPy
Evaluate, Datasets
Others (see notebook for complete list)
Aim of the Project
Build a text summarization pipeline using Gemma and LangChain.
Discuss critical parameters and methods for working with Large Language Models (LLMs).
Explore summarization techniques: Stuffing, MapReduce, and Refine.
Fine-tune Gemma using PEFT.
Propose next steps and future considerations.
Methods and Strategies
The project explores three main summarization methods:

Stuffing: Combines all input data into a single prompt.
MapReduce: Summarizes smaller chunks and combines results.
Refine: Iteratively improves the summary.
How to Use
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Load your dataset and configure the pipeline parameters, such as max_new_tokens and precision.

Run the notebook to generate summaries for your own data.

Fine-Tuning
The notebook includes an example of fine-tuning Gemma using LoRa, a PEFT method to adapt the model to specific datasets.

Conclusions and Next Steps
Future enhancements include integrating additional evaluation metrics, addressing hallucinations in LLM outputs, and improving summarization for domain-specific texts.
